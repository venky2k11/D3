        Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. The virus that
        causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or
        exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces. One can be
        infected by breathing in the virus if we are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching
        a contaminated surface and then our eyes, nose or mouth. With this, the general expectation is that places with
        highest density of human population should have large impact of COVID-19. Below chart's look at the spread of
        COVID-19 from a density perspective and the countries that have been impacted the most.

    <p>World map view showing total laboratory confirmed cases (till 4th July 2020) grouped by
        population density. Circle size reflects the total confirmed cases. For a pandemic like Corona virus,
        we would expect that highest density areas are likely be worst effected. However, looking at the chart,
        we see that this is not true. Countries like South Korea and Singapore have done far better in controlling
        the spread when compared to lower density countries like US and South America. Looking at the above map view,
        we could see that countries like US, Brazil, Russia and India have very high numbers compared to other
        countries. Hovering over the circle, we could see that US has the highest number of confirmed cases i.e.
        2839436.
        Let's look at the next chart to find out Top 10 effected countries.</p>

    <!-- Scene: 2 -->
    <h2>Top 10 Countries (Confirmed/Death cases):</h2>
    <div class="custom-input">
        <input id="ConfirmedButton" type="button" title="Click to show Confirmed Cases" value="Confirmed cases"></input>
        <input id="DeathButton" type="button" title="Click to show Death Cases" value="Death cases"></input>
    </div>
    <div id="my_dataviz3" style="text-align:center;"></div>

    <p>Top 4 countries shown here in this chart for number of confirmed cases is what we expected by looking at the
        above
        world map chart. The next 6 countries that have very close numbers to each others. US numbers are close to
        double of what next
        highest country Brazil.
        By selecting the button "Death cases", we see that US and Brazil have again appeared at the top of the chart
        with US
        almost double the numbers. Countries that appeared in top 10 for confirmed cases also make it to the
        top 10 list
        for death cases with exception of France and Iran suggesting, the death rates in France and Iran could be
        very
        high compared
        to other countries. Russia seems to have better control over death rate as even though they had high confirmed
        numbers,
        their death toll is comparitively lower than other top countries. From this, we could say that higher
        confirmed
        cases could lead to higher death toll however with greater control measures, we could reduce the death rates.

    <h2>Timeline of Confirmed cases - by Country:</h2>
    <div class="custom-select">
        <p>Select Country:</p>
        <select id="selectButton" style="text-align:center;"></select>
    </div>
    <div id="my_dataviz2" style="text-align:center;"></div>

    <p>Let's look at the country specific trend of the top 2 countries for confirmed cases. Selecting US from the
        dropdown, we see that it all started in around mid March. May and June months saw some control over the spread
        however,
        looking at the timeline <br>between June and July, the number of cases seem to be increasing again. If we look
        at
        Australia,
        that had a similar starting phase, has done much better to control the pandemic.From April, we could see the
        curve flatting out with some quick measures. <br>It is also very prominent that relaxed social distancing rules
        in
        July is
        showing increase in number again. It would be interesting to see if Australia can control the increase this
        again.</p>
    <p>Unlike US, the number of cases in Brazil has been consistently rising. It started shortly after US however it
        seems
        Brazil has done better than US in controlling the pandemic. However, the steady increase shows something is not
        working.
        More effective <br>measures are needed. </p>
